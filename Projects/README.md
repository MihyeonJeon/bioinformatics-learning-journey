### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Single-cell RNA Sequence Data Analysis
Description: This project was conducted during my internship. It involved analyzing single-cell RNA sequencing data, including quality control, clustering, and further scRNA-seq analysis.

Note: The code is not shared due to confidentiality agreements. The repository provides an overview of the project scope and approach.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Machine Learning - Data Exploration & Feature Selection
Description: This project focuses on data exploration and feature selection techniques applied as part of a machine learning course. The analysis was performed in R.

Files: Contains the R script used for analysis.

Note: The dataset used for this project is too large to upload to GitHub and is therefore not included in the repository.
